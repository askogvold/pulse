This is a quick test I did with my Polar WearLink Bluetooth heart rate monitor.

It is not a production ready app whatsoever, but gives a short introduction to using a heart rate monitor / bluetooth in general.
After implementing this, I found out that the [MyTracks](https://code.google.com/p/mytracks/) project also includes code for this and other
bluetooth heart rate monitors, and could be a nice starting point if you want to make a serious app around this.

The project also ended up being a test of Android Studio and the new Gradle build system.

Note that I'm not sure where I got the wav-file in the assets folder from, and you should therefore not use that if you
build on this project.
